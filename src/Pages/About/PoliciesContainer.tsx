          <h3>Security</h3>
          <p>
            We don't ask for a password, so we don't have to store your
            password. We rely on alternative means of authentication using your
            account on third party services, or an e-mail to your inbox.
          </p>
          <h3>Your data</h3>
          <p>
            It is necessary to have a piece of information unique to you in
            order to allow you to log in and keep playing the same game. We use
            your e-mail address. However we don't store the e-mail address
            itself. We scramble it through a one-way process to get an
            unpredictable code, and we store that instead.
          </p>
          <div className="m-hash-demo">
            <div className="m-hash-demo__email">name@example.com</div>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            We have no way of restoring your e-mail address back from this code.
            We cannot e-mail you from this data so you will not hear from us.
            There is no personally identifying data in our system. We also do
            not store which third-party account you used to tell us your e-mail
            address. We do not have any further access to those third party
            accounts and we cannot post as you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any e-mails we send rely on the e-mail address being provided at
            that point.<br />
            If somebody sends you an invite we will email you once, and not
            store your address. We will not be able to contact you again even if
            we wanted to.<br />
            When you request to log in via e-mail we send to the e-mail address
            you provide. It is not stored once sent.

                  that the game can become interactive faster, without having to
                  contact the server for data first. It is only used by your
