          You have tried to associate your anonymous account with an e-mail
          address which has already been registered. You have two options:
        </p>
        <h2>1. Register this anonymous account</h2>
        <p>
          To use <strong>this</strong> account as your preferred account, you
          will first need to delete your previous account which is linked to
          that e-mail address. To do this, login to the other account and visit
          the <a href="/profile/delete">Delete</a> page.
        </p>
        <MessageInfo>
          You should use an Incognito/Private window to login to your other
          account so that you do not lose this anonymous account.
        </MessageInfo>
        <p>
          Once the other account has been deleted, you will be able to register
          this account to that e-mail address on your{" "}
          <a href="/profile">Profile</a> page.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Use your already registered account</h2>
        <p>
          To use your other account, you will first have to log out of this
          anonymous account. You will then be able to log in to your registered
          account using the standard methods on the <a href="/login">Login</a>{" "}
          page
        </p>
      </div>
      <LogOutButtonContainer isAnonymous={true} />
    </AboutLayout>
